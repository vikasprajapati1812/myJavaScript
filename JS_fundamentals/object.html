    <h1>JavaScipt Objects</h1>
    <p>Here Everything is written about object here...</p>
    <p>an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a property.</p>

        <p>    The key of a property can be a string. The value of a property can be any value, e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function.</p>
        <p>      
        JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object. The most commonly used one is to use the object literal notation.</p>

    <script>

console.log("hello JavaSCript Objects");

console.log("Objects are written in key:value pairs.  Keys are also called as properties here.");
let person={
    firstName:"Vikas",
    lastName:"Prajapati",  // here fistName and lastName are the properties and person is an object.
    // if object have multiple properties they are seperated by the "," .
};

    //Acccessing the properties of objects.
    // Properties can be accessed in two ways.  1> Dot Notation     2> Array like Notation

    console.log(person.firstName);
   
   
    console.log(person[`firstName`]);     // person["firstName"] or person['firstName']  are all same.
    console.log(person['lastName']);
// we generally prefer the 2nd bcause sometime there is space in key . then it works  but the dot notation doesnot works on that.

//When a property name contains spaces, you need to place it inside quotes. For example, the following address object has the 'building no' as a property:
let address = {
    'building no': 3960,
    street: 'North 1st street',
    state: 'CA',
    country: 'USA'
};
console.log(address);
console.log(address.Prototype);
console.log(address['building no']);

// address.'building no';   // it will throw an error. SyntacError: Unexpected string
// Note that it is not a good practice to use spaces in the property names of an object.

//also if the properties didn't exists in the object then it will result in  "undefined"



//  Modifying the value of a property ---> (assignement operator "=") 

let person1 = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};

person1.firstName = 'Jane';

console.log(person1);

// if the property didnot exist while assigning then it automatically add that;

person1.salary=50000;

console.log(person1);
console.log(typeof person1);
console.log(typeof person1.salary)


// Deleting a property of an object

delete person1.salary;
console.log(person1);

console.log(person1.salary)   // if the thing is not present then it shows undefined


// Checking if a property exists --->  using the 'in' operator   returns the boolean value


let hero={
    firsttName:"Peter",
    LastName:"Parker",
    age:26,
};
console.log("father" in hero);   //false
console.log("age" in hero);    // true
