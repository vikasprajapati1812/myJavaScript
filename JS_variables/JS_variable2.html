    <h1>Variables</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>1. A variable is a label that references a value.</li>
        <li>2. Use the let keyword to declare a variable.</li>
        <li>3. An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but not initialized while an undeclared
            variable is a variable that has not been declared.</li>
        <li>4. Use the const keyword to define a readonly reference to a value.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Var</h2>
    <p>variables can be declared in 3ways, var let and const</p>
    <p>var are hoisted and are in global scope.
        var are declare initialise at any time and can be redeclared.
    </p>
    <h2>let</h2>

    <p>let and const are also said to be hoisted but they go through the temporal dead zone (tdz).
    </p>
    <p><em>let cannot redeclared and it can be initialised later .it has a block scope </em></p>
    <h2>const</h2>

    <p><em>Const cannot redeclared and it cannot be initialised later .
            it is declared and initialised at the same time.
            it has a block scope </em></p>

        console.log("vikas")
        let a = 10;
        a = 20;           // here it is assign to another value possible in let not in const
     //   let a=40;       // since here itis redeclared the same variable which is not possible 
        console.log(a)

        // const b=100;   
        // b=200;   // this will throw the Typeerror

        // the const should be declare and iniitialised in the same line otherwise it will throw and error.
