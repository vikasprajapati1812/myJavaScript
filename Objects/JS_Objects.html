      How to Define a JavaScript Object

        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Note:
        name:value pairs are also called key:value pairs.

        object literals are also called object initializers.</h2>

      <h2>Creating Objects</h2>
      <pre style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0)">
        <li>Creating a JavaScript Object:
            const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
        </li>
        <li>Using the new Keyword:
            // Create an Object
const person = new Object();

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
    Note:
The examples above do exactly the same.

But, there is no need to use new Object().

For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.
</li>



      <li>Using an Object Constructor</li>
      Note: in this we use the class(which is act as a blueprint for the
      objects) // Constructor function for Person objects function Person(first,
      last, age, eye) { this.firstName = first; this.lastName = last; this.age =
      age; this.eyeColor = eye; } // Create two Person objects const myFather =
      new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue"); const myMother = new
      Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
    </pre>
      <h2>
        In JavaScript, Objects are King. If you Understand Objects, you
        Understand JavaScript. Objects are containers for Properties and
        Methods. Properties are named Values. Methods are Functions stored as
        Properties. Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other
        objects.
      </h2>
      <ol>
        In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
        <li>Objects are objects</li>
        <li>Maths are objects</li>
        <li>Functions are objects</li>
        <li>Dates are objects</li>
        <li>Arrays are objects</li>
        <li>Maps are objects</li>
        <li>Sets are objects</li>
        <li>All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.</li>
